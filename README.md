# Assignment
You are tasked to create a Python script that will parse multiple CSVs and create a unified csv. There are 3 different CSVs, this will increase in the future.

There are 3 CSVs in the repo with the required data.

# Scoring
Create a script according to above specified requirements. You are allowed to take as much time as needed, but try to manage your time to around 1 or 2 hours. Since we are a Python shop the script must be done with Python. Scoring is based on:

1. Correctness
2. Code architecture
3. Maintainability
4. Testability
5. Extendibility
6. Pythonicness of code
7. Tests are not required, but plus points for tests.

This is a moment to show your skills. But remember simple is better than complex. Try to solve the assignment with the standard library of Python.

Note: The assignment example files are meant to be easy. The focus should be on the scoring points.
